-CS208 Assignment: Modeling Knox College's student, professors, majors etc.

Write a series of Python classes to model students, professors, course, classes, and majors. Implement as many of the magic methods as make sense for your model. Submit a git repo with a readme describing how to use your classes.
I will leave the specifics up to you but you should implement things like add/drop class, get_advisor/advisee, course requirements, major requirements.
Note that a class is a specific term offering of a course which is a more general description.
Because it is so open ended, I am offering up to 20% extra credit (this is your golden parachute for those of you who have been less than studious). The standard for 10% extra credit would be a barebones model with a readme ~100-150 lines of code. 20% would include a full demo and documentation ~500+ lines of code.
